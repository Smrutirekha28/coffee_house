model->route->controller


to connect the database through controller to model

to validate the data when we send the data to databse



index->allroutes->auth  routes->register , login            -> controller 
                ,prouct routes ->add,get,update,delete
                ,auth middlewares -> order  routes 


 controller communicate with database by model

controller is used to validation or control everything , it control or manage data and then give the response
controller keeps logic(get,post,update,delete) and response


view ->you can send the message as well as data
